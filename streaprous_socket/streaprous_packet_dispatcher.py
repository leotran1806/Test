"""
Streaprous packet dispatcher module based on queue. For each connection, a single thread that
reads from raw socket and dispatches packets to it associated queue.
Each queue is identified by its key includes (client_ip, client_port).
This module supports multiple processing flows (denoted by coonections) would call recvfrom() on the same socket.
